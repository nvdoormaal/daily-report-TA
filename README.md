# daily-report-TA
Creates a 3-paged pdf for law enforcement managers in protected areas. This report was specifically designed for a private nature reserve in South Africa. 
The report includes four components:
- a density map of vulnerable species and the patrol routes of the last 24 hours, 
- species sightings of the last 10 days
- visual of temporal activities of patrol teams
- a summary table of every patrol

The pdf is automatically generated at the end of the script. Unfortunately, it's not a plug-and-play yet, but hopefully it can help others to take useful chunks for their own reporting.
